# CairoPlayground

```Cairo is a language for writing provable programs: running a Cairo program produces a trace that can then be sent to a trustless prover, which generates a STARK proof for the validity of the statement or computation represented by the Cairo program. The proof can then be verified using a verifier (which may or may not be on-chain)```
